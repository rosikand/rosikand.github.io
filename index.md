#### **About**:





<p class="text-content">

- I am interested in AI research, ML engineering, startups, and venture capital.
- In the past, I've conducted **research** in self-supervised learning at [SAIL](https://ai.stanford.edu/), engineered segmentation models at **[insitro](https://www.insitro.com/)**, and built many ML projects.
- I also infrequently write about startups and venture capital on **Substack** at [Rohan's Random Walks](https://rosikand.substack.com/).
- In my free time, I play **[golf](./golf.md)** and poker. 
<!-- - Currently, I am working on a few projects: 
  - **edge VLA inference**: how to deploy and speed up large vision-language-action models to run on-device for robotic arms. 
  - **Research on scaling inference-time compute**: how to make inference-time compute more efficient for improved reasoning. 
  - **AI agents for geospatial intelligence**: query satellite imagery through natural language, in real-time, anywnere around the world.  -->

  I am interested in AI research, ML engineering, startups, and venture capital.

  In the past, I've conducted **research** in self-supervised learning at [SAIL](https://ai.stanford.edu/), engineered segmentation models at **[insitro](https://www.insitro.com/)**, and built many ML projects.

  I also infrequently write about startups and venture capital on **Substack** at [Rohan's Random Walks](https://rosikand.substack.com/).

  In my free time, I play **[golf](./cv.qmd)**. 

  Currently, I am working on a couple projects: 
    
- **edge VLA inference**: how to deploy and speed up large vision-language-action models to run on-device for robotic arms. 
- **Research on scaling inference-time compute**: how to make inference-time compute more efficient for improved reasoning.
